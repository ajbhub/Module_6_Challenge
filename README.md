# Module_6_Challenge
Background
Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that you’re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

For this Challenge assignment, you’ll need to create and submit the following deliverable:

A Jupyter notebook that contains your analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.


Instructions
Use the san_francisco_housing.ipynb notebook to visualize and analyze the real-estate data.

Note that this assignment requires you to create a visualization by using hvPlot and GeoViews. Additionally, you need to read the sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv file from the Resources folder into the notebook and create the DataFrame that you’ll use in the analysis.

The main task in this Challenge is to visualize and analyze the real-estate data in your Jupyter notebook. Use the san_francisco_housing.ipynb notebook to complete the following tasks:

Calculate and plot the housing units per year.

Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.

Compare the average prices by neighborhood.

Build an interactive neighborhood map.

Compose your data story.
